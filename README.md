# Test task for Smart-business Company
## JUNIOR FRONTEND DEVELOPER ASSIGNMENT

The goal of this task is to evaluate my skills in creating a React application using Redux Toolkit and TypeScript.\ 
I developed a user management table that displays user information fetched from a mock API, along with implementing local filter functionality, adding new users, editing user information, and deleting users.

## Implemented features:
1. Fetched All Users from JSONPlaceholder endpoint GET /users.
2. Displayed Users in a table with columns: name, username, email, and phone.
3. Implemented Advanced Filtering:\
• Added search input fields for each column (name, username, email, phone).\
• The table dynamically filters results based on user input in these fields, with real-time updates.
4. Implemented adding a new user to the table end with validation empty inputs value.
5. Implemented editing user information functionality with validation empty inputs value.
6. Implemented deleting users from the table.
7. State Management. Used Redux Toolkit to manage the application state, including user data, adding, editing, deleting, and filter states.
8. Used TypeScript across the entire web application to ensure proper typing and reduce potential runtime errors.
9. Design and Styling. Applied custom minimalistic styles using SCSS to ensure a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
